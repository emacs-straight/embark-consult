;;; Commentary:

;; This packages provides two commands, `avy-embark-collect-choose' and
;; `avy-embark-collect-act', that use avy to jump to an Embark Collect
;; entry and choose it or act on it, respectively.

;; I no longer recommend using this package, and suggest users migrate
;; to the excellent link-hint package by Fox Kiester.
