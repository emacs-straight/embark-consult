;;; Commentary:

;; This package configures the Embark package for use in Org Mode
;; buffers. It teaches Embark a number of Org related targets and
;; appropriate actions. Currently it has table cells, whole tables,
;; and links. Targets to add: headings (Embark already has generic
;; support for outlines, so we just nee to add Org specific actions),
;; dates, source blocks, etc.

;;; Code:

(require 'embark)
(require 'org)

;;; Tables

;; We define both cell and table targets

;;; Links

;; The link support has a slightly complicated design in order to
;; achieve the following goals:

;; 1. RET should simply be org-open-at-point

;; 2. When the link is to a file, URL, email address or elisp
;;    expression or command, we want to offer the user actions for
;;    that underlying type.

;; 3. Even in those cases, we still want some actions to apply to the
;;    entire link including description: actions to copy the link as
;;    markdown, or just the link description or target.

;; So the strategy is as follows (illustrated with file links):

;; - The target will be just the file, without the description and
;;   also without the "file:" prefix nor the "::line-number or search"
;;   suffix.  That way, file actions will correctly apply to it.

;; - The type will not be 'file, but 'org-file-link that way we can
;;   register a keymap for 'org-file-link that inherits from both
;;   embark-org-link-map (with RET bound to org-open-at-point and a
;;   few other generic link actions) and embark-file-map.

;; - The commands to copy the link at point in some format will be
;;   written as commands that act on the Org link at point.  This way
;;   they are independently (plausibly) useful, and we circumvent the
;;   problem that the whole Org link is not actually the target (just
;;   the inner file is!).

;; Alternative design I considered: separate each target into two, a
;; whole link target which includes the description and brackets and
;; what not; and an "inner target" which is just the file or URL or
;; whatever.  Cons of this approach: much target cycling is required!
;; First of all, an unadorned embark-dwim definitely should be
;; org-open-at-point, which means the whole link target would need
;; priority. That means that any file, URL, etc. actions would require
;; you to cycle first.  This sounds very inconvenient, the above
;; slightly more complex design allows both whole-link and inner
;; target actions to work without cycling.
